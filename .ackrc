# ack - grep-like text finder

# Sorts the found files lexicographically. Makes file listings to be

# The default ack colors are designed for dark terminal theme.
#
# The recognized attributes are clear, reset, dark, bold, underline,
# underscore, blink, reverse, concealed black, red, green, yellow, blue,
# magenta, on_black, on_red, on_green, on_yellow, on_blue, on_magenta, on_cyan,
# and on_white.
#
# Case is not significant. Underline and underscore are equivalent, as are
# clear and reset. The color alone sets the foreground color, and on_color sets
# the background color.
